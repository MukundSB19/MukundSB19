React Native Developer & Designer
I'm Mukund Singh, a 20-year-old app developer and UI/UX designer with a deep passion for building clean, real-time, user-friendly mobile apps. I specialize in React Native, combining the power of JavaScript, typeScript and design to craft experiences that not only work  but feel great.

I'm currently:

🔨 Building projects with React Native, TypeScript, and Expo

🧠 Learning animations, backend integration, and real-time logic

🎯 Focused on turning skills into solid income and long-term impact

“Design like a user. Build like a hacker. Ship like a founder.”
